  Here's a scene:

  Lena stood at the edge of the old pier, the wooden planks creaking beneath her feet as she gazed out at the moonlit lake. The water was calm, reflecting the stars like a mirror, and a faint mist rose from its surface. A lone sailboat bobbed gently in the distance, its sails furled and silent. Lena closed her eyes, feeling the cool night air fill her lungs, and listened to the sound of the water lapping against the shore. Suddenly, she heard the soft crunch of gravel behind her, and turned to see a figure emerging from the darkness.
