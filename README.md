# app
This is a app created with react and wrangler

To run the app, do `pnpm dev`, it is also available on https://my-react-app.hongleigu19.workers.dev/ (please dont mind the name, I forgot to change it on project init)

## Usage:

so the app has only one page, the default workflow to trigger is as follows:

input a text and send -> AI generation -> rewrite for image prompt -> image generation
